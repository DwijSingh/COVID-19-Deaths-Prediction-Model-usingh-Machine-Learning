Covid-19 is one of the deadliest viruses youâ€™ve ever heard. Mutations in covid-19 make it either more deadly or more infectious. We have seen a lot of deaths from covid-19 while there is a higher wave of cases. We can use historical data on covid-19 cases and deaths to predict the number of deaths in the future. So if you want to learn how to predict covid-19 deaths with machine learning, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through the task of Covid-19 deaths prediction with machine learning using Python.

<h3>Covid-19 Deaths Predictions (Case Study)</h3>
You are given a dataset of Covid-19 in India from 30 January 2020 to 18 January 2022. The dataset contains information about the daily confirmed cases and deaths. Below are all the columns of the dataset:

Date: Contains the date of the record
Date_YMD: Contains date in Year-Month-Day Format
Daily Confirmed: Contains the daily confirmed cases of Covid-19
Daily Deceased: Contains the daily deaths due to Covid-19
You need to use this historical data of covid-19 cases and deaths to predict the number of deaths for the next 30 days.
